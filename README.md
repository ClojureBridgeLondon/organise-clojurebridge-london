An overview of the steps required to run a ClojureBridge London Event, helping you naviagate all the currently available content.  Further advice is available in the [clojurebridge/organizing](https://github.com/ClojureBridge/organizing) repository.

# Organising team

There should be 2-4 people involved in organising a ClojureBridge London event, to help spread the work around.  Clojurebridge.org recommends you join their [organising mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/clojurebridge-workshops)

# Venue & Host 

Select a suitable venue and a host (person who works at the venue).  The host should preferably be one of the organisers.

A suitable venue should include:

* a good WiFi network
* a large screen / projector for opening presentations
* tables, chairs & external monitor (24 inch or larger) for each group
* space for breakfast / lunch
* female hygiene products available
* disabled access

# Budget

Establish the budget for the event (contact previous organisers for sample budgets)

# Sponsorship

Sponsors for the event can provide additional funds to cover the budget or provide content or services that support or complement the event.

Previous sponsors include:
* uSwitch 
* Thoughtworks
* Style.com
* GDS

Contact previous ClojureBridge London organisers via email for sponsor contacts.

# Managing the event

The current recommendations for mananging the event is to create the following:

* Create ClojureBridge London event - [example issue on clojurebridge/Workshops repository](https://github.com/ClojureBridge/Workshops/issues/38) 
* Student event on Meetup.com - [example event](https://www.meetup.com/London-Clojurians/events/233369825/)
* [Student experience form (Google Form)](https://bit.ly/clojurebridgelondon-signup)
* Volunteer event on Meetup.com - [example event](https://www.meetup.com/London-Clojurians/events/234511179/)
* Volunteer experience form (Google Forms)

The organising team should have access to the ClojureBridge London email and [twitter](https://twitter.com/ClojureBridgeLN) accounts, email "clojurebridge dot london at gmail dot com" for access.  

> An existing organiser can give you deligated access to the gmail account and shared access to the twitter acount via tweetdeck.
