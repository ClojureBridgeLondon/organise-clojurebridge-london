# How to run a ClojureBridge London Event

ClojureBridge aims to increase diversity within the Clojure community by offering free, beginner-friendly Clojure programming workshops for underrepresented groups in tech.

Early workshops focused on women. Organizers are free to choose a different underrepresented group when planning a workshop. A workshop's description should state the group or groups for which the workshop is to be held.

ClojureBridge was started in 2014 and is part of [Bridge Foundry](http://bridgefoundry.org/). [All around the world](http://www.clojurebridge.org/) there have been workshops organised by people like you.

Here is an overview of the steps required to run a ClojureBridge London Event, helping you navigate all the currently available content.  Further advice is available in the [clojurebridge/organizing](https://github.com/ClojureBridge/organizing) repository, or email the London ClojureBridge team at "clojurebridge dot london at gmail dot com".

# Roles to assign

There should be 2-4 people involved in organising a ClojureBridge London event, to help spread the work around.  ClojureBridge.org recommends you join their [organising mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/clojurebridge-workshops).

At every ClojureBridge workshop someone needs to take responsibility for each of the following roles.  A person can take on more than one role, however each role does require an amount of work.

* Organiser - runs the overall event and makes sure everything happens.  They are also the public face of the event, so this person should preferably represent the community you are trying to reach. Organisers should take a look at the [organising timeline](https://github.com/ClojureBridge/organizing/blob/master/Workshop-Planning-Timeline.md) and an example [organising Trello board can be found here](https://trello.com/b/VDKueBHg/clojurebridge-london-example-organising-board).
* Host - ensures access to the venue and provides all the services
* Sponsor - provides some or all of the financial support
* Teacher Trainer - teaches the teachers & assistants about the event and manages consensus of how the event will work on the day.
* Teachers - leads a group of students during the workshop, helps with install party
* Assistants - supports the teacher during the workshop, helps with install party 

Optionally you can have someone who promotes the event; however, it may be that everyone pitches in.  It's best to co-ordinate promoting the event, so you inform any specific communities you are trying to reach first.

# Venue & Host 

Select a suitable venue and a host (person who works at the venue).  The host should preferably be one of the organisers.

A suitable venue should include:
* space for at least 30 people, preferably 50 (ie. 35 students, 15 volunteers)
* a good WiFi network
* a large screen / projector for opening presentations
* tables, chairs & external monitor (24 inch or larger) for each group
* space for breakfast / lunch
* female hygiene products available
* disabled access

# Budget

Typically, a ClojureBridge event can be catered for up to 50 people for £1,000, or conservatively with a budget of £750, broken down as follows:

* Friday & Saturday snacks & drinks such as crisps, fruit, small amounts of beer, wine: £150
* Friday install party dinner such as pizza, mini burritos etc.: £200-250
* Saturday breakfast such as bagels, porridge, fruit etc. & coffee: £150
* Saturday lunch such as bento boxes, hummus bowls, salads etc.: £250
* Saturday afternoon ClojureBridge branded cookies or cupcakes such as [crumbs and doilies](http://www.crumbsanddoilies.co.uk/): £75-100
* Optional Saturday post-workshop social bar tab: £200-500

This doesn't include venue or additional costs, so adjust your budget accordingly and contact [previous organisers](https://github.com/orgs/ClojureBridgeLondon/people) for more info.

# Sponsorship

Sponsors for the event can provide additional funds to cover the budget or provide content or services that support or complement the event.

Previous sponsors & hosts include:
* Entrepreneur First
* 8th Light
* Skills Matter (Code Node)
* Signal Media
* uSwitch 
* ThoughtWorks
* Style.com
* GDS

Contact previous [ClojureBridge London organisers](https://github.com/orgs/ClojureBridgeLondon/people) via email or "clojurebridge dot london at gmail dot com" for sponsor contacts.

# Managing the event

Managing the event is made much easier by using a few simple tools. The current recommendations for managing the event is to do the following:

* Update the [ClojureBridge London website](https://clojurebridgelondon.github.io/) by editing the [index.html](https://github.com/ClojureBridgeLondon/clojurebridgelondon.github.io/blob/master/index.html) file and updating event specific details (date, location, organisers, sponsors, etc.)
* Create a ClojureBridge London issue in the ClojureBridge repo - [example issues on clojurebridge/Workshops repository](https://github.com/ClojureBridge/Workshops/issues) 
* Create (or copy) a new student event on Meetup.com - [example event](https://www.meetup.com/London-Clojurians/events/233369825/)
* Create (or reopen) a [student experience form (Google Form)](https://bit.ly/clojurebridgelondon-signup)
* Create (or copy) a new volunteer event on Meetup.com - [example event](https://www.meetup.com/London-Clojurians/events/234511179/)
* Create (or reopen) a [volunteer experience form (Google Forms)](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdTOdF_26z0lh-yHJDSc8tjFd_CoVpTdvb-4MMg7n44EIC4dQ/viewform)

Contact "clojurebridge dot london at gmail dot com" for access to these accounts.

We encourage volunteers & students to share their programming & Clojure experience levels with us via the google forms, to make it easier to group teachers with students.  The student experience google form has a question to confirm gender identification, our main way to ensure we are creating a suitable working space for students.

## Contacts & account access

Contact us at "clojurebridge dot london at gmail dot com", via the [ClojureBridge London Slack channel](https://clojurians.slack.com/messages/C4VF2PZD0/) or [here to sign up to Slack](http://clojurians.net/)

The [organising team](https://github.com/orgs/ClojureBridgeLondon/people) should have access to the ClojureBridge London email and [twitter](https://twitter.com/ClojureBridgeLN) accounts, email "clojurebridge dot london at gmail dot com" for access.  Please send all email communications from this account (or cc the email address) so we can track communications (avoid duplication, better manage any issues).

> An [existing organiser](https://github.com/orgs/ClojureBridgeLondon/people) can give you delegated access to the Gmail and Mailchimp accounts, as well as shared access to the Twitter account via TweetDeck.

# Promoting the event

The [ClojureBridge London website](https://clojurebridgelondon.github.io/) is a simple html website with all the information about the event (or links to relevant content), so it can be used to promote the event too (along with the meetup events & clojurebridge.org event pages).

# Teacher Training

A teacher training evening should be run approximately two to three weeks before the event, to ensure the teachers and assistants have enough time to prepare and are fully aware of their obligations.

You will need a volunteer to lead the training session and go through the [ClojureBridge London Volunteer presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1YjqllOqaGvyAPfKBaRbNfotXBaXpqa5_wSy62VhPM7I/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000).  This event covers the code of conduct, default development tool use, review of the curriculum.  It is important for all volunteers to attend.

Additional resources include the [ClojureBridge Teaching Guide](https://github.com/ClojureBridge/curriculum/blob/gh-pages/TEACHING.md)
